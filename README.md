Simple Streamlit app to parse and view Cookie Clicker save data.

Yes, some data is still missing because I simply have not gotten that far into the game yet. I'll add on and replace placeholders as I progress.

`main.py` has the text-based app that runs in the terminal and `app.py` has the Streamlit app. Optimized for dark mode because streamlit doesn't let you see what mode the user has selected >:(
